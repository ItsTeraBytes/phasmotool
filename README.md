# ![](src/favicon.ico) PhasmoHelper - Jobus Fork
A web app to help find ghosts in the game Phasmophobia.

This is a heavily modified fork of the now-dead [phasmohelper](https://github.com/zuffdaddy/phasmohelper).

Changes from the original:
- Greatly minimalized; does away with flavor and introductory text. Focus on the game details that can't be found in-game.
- Changed evidence sliders to toggles. Right-click to cross out.
- Can click on a ghost's name to individually exclude it.
- Additional toggles for abnormal ghost behavior like early hunts.
- In Nightmare mode, highlight guaranteed evidence with dotted borders.
- Cursed possession toggling: the other buttons no longer disappear when you open one of them, and the description is instead placed below.
- Official ghost icons next to the names.
- 'R' hotkey to reset evidence.
